# All-in-One Outdoor Activity Website

## Project Concept
Our vision is to craft a streamlined and user-friendly website catering to enthusiasts of the great outdoors. This hub will be the go-to source for comprehensive details on the best beaches, hiking trails, and scenic overlooks.

## Week 4 Progress Report
In the fourth week, we implemented Zipcode Search functionality. Upon clicking on beaches, address and reviews of that particular beach are displayed in a pop-up. Backend efforts are underway to establish robust database interactions for managing user data for Client and login pages.

### Client-Page Functionalities
- A fixed glass-style navbar with a logo and navigation links.
- Includes Home, Activities, Explore, Tours, About, Contact, and a LogOut button.
- JavaScript event listener on the menu button for mobile responsiveness.
- Events section to inform visitors about various upcoming events like "TrekDiscover," "SightScope," and "Beachscape."
- Zipcode search functionality for users to search nearby beaches.
- Display of the selected beach's address and reviews upon click.
