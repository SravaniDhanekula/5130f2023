I have included lab2.js and signup.html,login.html,signin.html file.
In lab2.js, I have all the code for validating the inputs from the Node.js terminal.
In signup.html, I have written the html code for displaying the validation form UI with the necessary inputs. In that UI, email, and passwords and their validation functionality has been included.
