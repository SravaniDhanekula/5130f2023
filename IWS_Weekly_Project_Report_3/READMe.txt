Project Name: All-in-One Outdoor Activity Website

Project Concept: Our vision is to craft a streamlined and user-friendly website catering to enthusiasts of the great outdoors. This hub will be the go-to source for comprehensive details on the best beaches, hiking trails, and scenic overlooks.

Week 3 Progress Report:
In the third week, we added functionalities for upcoming events in nearby trails, beaches, and sightseeing spots, integrating with Google Maps for easy location tracking. These enhancements offer detailed information and navigation assistance, enriching user experience for outdoor and cultural explorations. This integration aims to make trip planning and discovery more intuitive and user-friendly.
Backend efforts are underway to establish robust database interactions for managing user data for Client and login pages. This Client page represents the tourism or adventure-themed website, with a focus on tours, events, and exploration. 
Run adventure.html file to see the Client page and its implemented functionalities are seen upon respective button clicks.

Client-Page Functionalities:
------------------------------
1. A fixed glass-style navbar with a logo and navigation links.
2. Includes Home, Activities, Explore, Tours, About, Contact, and a LogOut button. These likely link to respective sections of the page.
3. There is a JavaScript event listener on the menu button for mobile responsiveness, toggling a class for a mobile menu view.
4. Events section is included to inform visitors about various upcoming events like "TrekDiscover", "SightScope", and "Beachscape".
5. Tours section is added to find the details about upcoming tours and destinations with dates and brief descriptions.
6. A checkbox for switching between light and dark modes, enhancing user experience and accessibility is included.
7. CSS files for the main style and responsive design, indicating adaptability to different screen sizes has been implemented.

Encountered Issues:
--------------------
1. Elements might not be aligning or resizing correctly on different devices or screen orientations. Using responsive design practices, including flexible grids and media queries, to ensure the layout adapts to different screen sizes.

2. Images might not load correctly, or the site might load slowly due to large image files. Optimizing images for web use (reduce file size while maintaining quality). So we implemented lazy loading for images.

3. The button does not take the user back to the top of the page.JavaScript associated with the #upbtn is properly implemented to smoothly scroll to the top of the page.

4. We encountered an issue with the Google API integration, which requires enhancement to improve its functionality and user experience. The problem pertains to inconsistent data retrieval and mapping accuracy, affecting the seamless integration of location-based services in our application. We have addressed this since this will enhance the overall performance and reliability of our location tracking features.

Planned Enhancements:
-----------------------
1. Refined navigation and seamless integration of the dashboard with login and sign-up modules.
2. Implementation of SQL Lite3 for efficient storage and retrieval of user credentials and profile information.
3. Aesthetic and functional enhancement of the CSS for login and sign-up interfaces.
4. Development of a dynamic 'Adventure' section encompassing Home, Activities, Explore, Tours, About, and Contact Information, complete with pertinent features.
5. Crafting a responsive UI for an intuitive dashboard experience.
6. Responsive integration of Google Maps, tailored to user-selected locales.

Achievements/ Accomplishments:
-----------------------
1. I have completed the construction of the HTML structure for the Client page and developed the Beaches page, incorporating essential HTML and JavaScript code. Additionally, I have integrated the Google API to enable the identification of beaches within a 50 km radius.

2. The API queries Google Maps to retrieve information about beaches in the vicinity, including names, distances, and directions.Features like zoom-in, zoom-out, and pan are available for users to explore the map in detail.

3. This integration makes the process of finding nearby beaches simple and user-friendly. Users can plan their beach visits more effectively, having all the necessary information at their fingertips.

4. We have begun discussions on how to effectively synchronize the Client page and login features with the database. Significant strides have also been made in crafting diverse sections of the Client page application, aiming to enhance user engagement.

5. Moreover, our team has agreed upon the database design for our project. Following this agreement, we have distributed specific tasks among team members to ensure efficient and organized implementation.

Next Steps:
------------------------
In the upcoming week, our objectives include:

1. Execution of CRUD operations and establishing a definitive database schema.
2. Further development and enhancement of the Client interface along with the introduction of JavaScript-based routing.
3. Also, implementing the functionalities of all the sections in the Client Page by populating values and its features.
4. Trying to implement zipcode based search for the nearby beaches,trails and sightseeing spots.
5. Saving user details in database while Sign Up.
