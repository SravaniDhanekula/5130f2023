Topic: Security in Internet Web-Systems

ABSTRACT:
The paper addresses the significant concerns of security and privacy in web systems. It discusses various aspects of web and network security, its flaws, and weaknesses. The focus is on key networking security strategies like firewalls, encryption, authentication, and integrity, alongside the architecture of web applications and attack methodologies. It also explores different security protection approaches and examines viral outbreaks in emerging networks. Nowadays, keeping web systems safe and private is a major issue. People using the internet for shopping or connecting with others want their messages to stay private. The paper also looks at important security methods like firewalls, passwords, encryption, checking identities, and keeping data accurate and untampered. It examines ways to protect against fast-growing internet threats, like DNS and one-time passwords, and group-based network defense. Additionally, it studies the rapid spread of viruses in emerging networks.

INTRODUCTION:
The paper starts by acknowledging the challenges in ensuring absolute trust and confidence in internet security and web applications. It underlines the importance of web security as the practice of protecting personal and organizational information shared on the Internet. The paper points out that most web applications have significant security concerns and emphasizes the need to understand weaknesses in web components.Cybersecurity involves protecting devices and websites from harmful sites, links, and attacks aimed at stealing data, damaging devices, or extorting money. As attackers grow more skilled, setting up good defenses is challenging. Attacks like phishing, ransomware, social engineering, and malware have specific goals. Cybersecurity has three main areas: network security, cloud security, and physical security.

ANALYSIS:
In network security, the user side is built using programming languages, including SQL. The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) links the application and database. Each website's uniqueness comes from its organizational processes. Research shows that administrative errors often lead to security gaps not immediately obvious on websites. Short-term fixes to these issues can lead to further problems, risking sensitive data exposure and damaging the institution's reputation. It discusses administrative errors leading to vulnerabilities, short-term fixes that lead to other issues, and the lack of regular monitoring of security tools like firewalls. The paper also explores key networking strategies, such as encryption, HTTPS or Secure Socket Layer, firewalls, and Intrusion Detection Systems, discussing their benefits and limitations.

DISCUSSION:
In this section, the paper likely delves into a deeper discussion of the findings from the analysis, possibly comparing different security approaches and highlighting the criticality of understanding attacker methodologies.Every business website is at risk of being attacked; it's just a matter of when. For example, attackers have exploited security flaws in websites like Western Union and Walt Disney Company to access web data or information from related systems and databases. It's important to understand that using security tools alone isn't enough to fully protect a website. These tools include encryption and decryption, HTTPS or Secure Socket Layer, accounts and passwords, listening or scanning programs, firewalls, and Intrusion Detection Systems. Each of these plays a part in web security.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Regular monitoring and updating of security tools.
2. Enhanced training and awareness for staff on cybersecurity issues.
3. Implementation of comprehensive security strategies that go beyond basic tools like firewalls and intrusion detection systems.

LIMITATIONS AND FUTURE PLANS:
1. Security tools like firewalls and intrusion detection systems are not monitored regularly, leading to weak security.
2. There's a lack of comprehensive understanding of the relationship between business issues and cybersecurity.
3. Often, non-expert individuals are tasked with security roles without proper training.

CONCLUSION:
The conclusion summarizes the key points discussed in the paper, reiterating the importance of network security components, their limitations, and the need for a holistic approach to web application security.Protecting web applications is a big challenge in computer security. These applications, like those handling banking and credit card details, are always at risk of being attacked. This paper reviews various internet security methods to safeguard web applications. It also examines how attackers plan and carry out attacks. Special focus is given to SQL Injection, a significant method for accessing database management systems (DBMS) data. The paper also discusses worms and viruses due to their importance in security threats.
